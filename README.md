Utopia Logging library is simple and lite library for logging information, such as errors or warnings. This library is aiming to be as simple and easy to learn and use. This library is maintained by the [Appwrite team](https://appwrite.io).

Although this library is part of the [Utopia Framework](https://github.com/utopia-php/framework) project, it is completely **dependency-free** and can be used as standalone with any other PHP project or framework.

## Getting Started

Install using composer:
```bash
composer require utopia-php/logging
```

```php
<?php

require_once '../vendor/autoload.php';

use blabla;

blabla
```

## Library API

* **blabla()** - bla bla

> bla bla
>
